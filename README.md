# StudentPerformancePrediction-ML
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning classifiers to predict the factors influencing student grades, leveraging a comprehensive dataset sourced from a CSV file.

Overview
In this project, we analyze a dataset comprising students from various nationalities and educational levels, alongside key determinants of academic performance, including metrics such as the number of hands raised in class, attendance records, and hours studied. The goal is to uncover which factors most significantly impact student grades.

Methodology
We employ a range of machine learning models and classifiers to achieve the highest accuracy in predicting student performance. The models include but are not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Classifiers
Each model is meticulously evaluated to identify the best-performing algorithm based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Data Visualization
To enhance understanding and interpretation of the results, various visual aids have been created, including:

Graphs: Illustrating relationships between key features and student grades, allowing for visual insights into data trends.
Confusion Matrix: Providing a clear representation of model performance, showcasing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
By combining rigorous statistical analysis with compelling visualizations, this project aims to deliver actionable insights into the factors affecting student performance, facilitating targeted interventions and support strategies for educators and students alike.
